Every Funtypes Codec has an `introspection` property, that contains metadata about the structure of the codec. Most users will not need to worry about this, but advanced users can look into that property to retrieve information about the underlying structure of the codec.

The types for the introspection property are best looked at [in the source code](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/funtypes/blob/master/src/introspection.ts).
